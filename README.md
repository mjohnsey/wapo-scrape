# Wapo Scrape

This is based on the idea of [@nyt_diff](https://twitter.com/nyt_diff).

## Notes

- Looks like this used to happen at [@wapo_diff](https://twitter.com/wapo_diff) using an [RSS feed diff engine](https://github.com/DocNow/diffengine). Has not posted in a while and I don't want to depend on RSS.
